# This example is the file that controls the state of SELinux on the
# system.  It normally resides at /etc/selinux/config and must be
# updated whenever the policy changes.  Use the script
# /usr/sbin/update-selinux-config to change the policy type, and then
# reload the policy for changes to go into effect.

# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
# enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
# permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
# disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=enforcing

# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these two values:
# refpolicy-targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected.
# refpolicy-strict   - Full SELinux protection.
# refpolicy-src      - Custom policy built from source
SELINUXTYPE=refpolicy

# SETLOCALDEFS= Check local definition changes
SETLOCALDEFS=0
